Title : One card to replace all cards

Idea :-

HERE WE ARE TRYING TO MAKE HANDLING MUCH MORE EASIER BY
INTRODUCING A SINGLE CARD THAT CONTAINS ALL THE DETAILS OF VARIOUS
BANKS AND THUS MAKING THE PAYMENT PROCESS EASIER AND FASTER AS THE
CUSTOMER NEED NOT TO FILL EVERY DETAILS AS IT IS FULLY AUTOMATED. THIS
CARD CAN ALSO BE USED FOR TRANSPORTATION CONVIENENCE BY
REDUCING THE TIME SPENT WAITING IN THE QUEUE.

You can use the One Card to pay for buses, metro, trains, parking fees, tolls and even to
shop or withdraw money. The service area feature of this card also supports operator
specific applications like monthly passes, season tickets etc. It can also be used at
Discover and Diner Club International Merchants.

Main feature of the card is you donâ€™t require to feed the card details and data it work
automatically once card added.
